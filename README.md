My first (still very WIP) Vue project written in Vue 3 (Composition API, script setup) and Pinia using Vite.

## To-do plans
- Make it accessible - currently the game is not accessible at all and that bothers me a lot, so that's the first thing I'm gonna look into
- Better design - as I'm mainly focused on learning Vue in this project, I didn't put much thought into design / CSS
- In the Score part, there could be some "full results" stuff which would show what user got wrong


## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
